We joke, but Aureus is an extremely disgusting serverside. It exploits artists even more so than regular serverside executors. I remember watching a documentary about the contracts they make people follow, and how they have camps for 9-year-olds to see who they can manipulate into being a haxor. And the UI itself is pretty much brainwashing people into being happy with their mundane, shitty scripts. Fuck Aureus, and fuck the keebs who worship it.
